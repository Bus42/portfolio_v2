## Optimization
+ Utilize caching
+ Refactor components to use hooks. Start with Certifications.js
+ Currently Certifications and Gallery components are exactly the same except for the data passed in via module import. Find a way to change this structure to utilize a single component and pass data as props

## Styling
+ Change paragraph font to make it more legible.

## Components
### Project Gallery
+ Convert selected projects to PWAs and include download to phone link visible only to andoroid/ios users
+ Resize images for faster load time
+ Use uniform size and aspect ratio for images for cleaner rendering

### Certifications
+ Add description to cards, include links to project pens created while obtaining certification
+ Fix alignment on desktop display - use 'space-evenly'
